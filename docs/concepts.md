Concepts
========

There are a handful of monitoring strategies we will consider.

The first concept is monitoring the path of a set of tasks
making up a workflow.

This is not about orchestrating a workflow, but rather tracking
a collection of tasks that make up a workflow. This allows
for different steps to be performed using different tools but providing
the monitoring to track the flow.
